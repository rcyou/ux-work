What if we put parenting on our resumes & LinkedIn profiles?

Career coaches &amp; hiring gurus say you need to include metrics to prove your impact.

Maybe something like …

- Increased MoM vegetable consumption by 36%
- Achieved 75% compliance 1 year after introducing potty training pilot program
- Expanded vocabulary by +27 words per quarter

Of course, this seems silly.

The numbers don't tell the whole story. The numbers aren't important!

What's important are the small wins &amp; baby steps (pardon the pun).

Sometimes I think people in hiring positions get too hung up on seeing outcomes that they forget the messy, invisible work that makes progress possible.

In design the outcome at times isn't apparent until years later, much like parenting.
