If feedback is a gift then why does it seem like companies don’t want to hear it?

The people who work at my nearest Starbucks make it a destination. I stopped in last week to hang out for a few hours and work on some writing.

After soaking in the friendly vibes and sitting in the cheerful buzz while the staff served customers, I felt compelled to give them kudos.

“Corporate needs to know how nice it is to be here,” I thought.

Opening a new tab in my browser, I searched for the store page, thinking there would be a place to leave feedback.

Nope.

Next, a more direct search, “starbucks leave feedback,” took me to the Contact Us page.

Nope.

I looked at the sticker on my cup thinking there was a URL or QR code.

Nope.

Eventually I stumbled upon the Customer Service site and somehow found a FAQ titled “How can I comment or give feedback about an experience I had in a Starbucks store?”

That directed me to “please contact us with your comments …” except the link took me back to the Customer Service homepage.

_Argh!_

Near the bottom of the page were 3 CTAs to chat, call, or send a message. Send a message seemed most appropriate.

Instead I was met with a self-service gate. “Before you contact us … describe your issue.”
After a couple tries, I noticed that typing something into the search field would reveal a “Contact” button.

A few more steps, and I finally arrived at a form.

It didn’t even cross my mind to complain about this shitty help desk workflow. I just wanted to give the store manager and team their flowers.

Days after <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-closed-over-450-stores-191920228.html" target="_blank">Starbucks closed 450 stores</a>, this one felt alive, led by a manager who valued his people. Cheers to you, Ryan at Store 82322 off Grand Prairie.

Even with amazing local spots like Chain & Spoke and The Coffeesmith, experiences like this keep me loyal to Starbucks.

But Mr. Niccols: Giving feedback shouldn’t be harder than ordering a latte.
