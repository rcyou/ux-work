Week notes will be my chance to collect my thoughts about many different topics that I dabble in for my job as a UX designer. It will also be an opportunity to share the various sites and articles I come across during research (or out of genuine curiosity).

So often, I notice myself saying, 'Oh yeah! I recently read about that …' but can't remember the source – only to spend the next 30 minutes pecking through my browser history.

I won't get into details about my employer or specifics related to the projects I may be currently working on. But I hope to share knowledge and insight that others may find interesting and relevant.

I definitely feel myself aging toward the next phase of my career, which involves management, though mentoring and coaching are more of the areas I gravitate towards most. Recently, I've reflect on past jobs and found a pattern tied to developing design culture. Either there wasn't one and I wanted to build it, or there was one, and I wanted others to experience it.

Lately, the situation is a mix of the two where there is culture, but the challenge lies in adapting it to fit the new remote working style.

More to come on this topic for sure.

### Design Teams

I discovered some design teams at large companies combine marketing and UX groups (something I feel is beneficial for several reasons) and they even have their own sites and blogs!
