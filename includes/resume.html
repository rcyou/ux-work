    <p>As a UI & UX designer on cross-functional Agile teams, I translate broad ideas and business requirements into design flows and practical user interfaces. Through quick prototypes, I am able to gather feedback on ideas and concepts in order to align everyone on goals and inspire stakeholders. Collaboration with developers and project managers is fundamental, as well as being able to execute within unknown or vague boundaries.</p>
