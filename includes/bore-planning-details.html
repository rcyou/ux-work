    <h2 class="subheader">How might we Help Directional Drillers Get Back on Plan when they Accidentally Veer Off Course?</h2>
    <p>Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) or directional boring is something you may have  seen but never paid much attention to. It’s a method of installng underground utilities without needing to dig a trench or pathway to place the cables or pipe.</p>
    <p>In it’s simplest form, there are as few as  two crew members – one on the drill rig forcing large rods into the Earth to create a hole, and one out in front with something that looks like a metal detector, which is able to tell where the drill head is underground. This last person is called a locator, and they relay the information about the drill head to the drill operator in order to steer and create the hole.</p>
    <p>Vermeer asked our team to update it’s propriatary on-rig directional drilling software and include a new a feature that alerts and assists operators when the intended trajectory of their drill has changed while it’s moving underground.</p>

<section>
    <p>This project remains ongoing. However my contributions in the earlier phases came within the first 6 months, approximately. During this time we worked on a 2-week sprint cadence, ending each sprint with a demo of our team’s progress.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Research</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">Unpacking the Problem</h2>
    <p>We were first given a wish list of sorts that contained a mix of existing and new software features, including an auto-correct feature aimed at helping drillers get back on their planned path.</p>
    <p>In order to learn more about the problem domain, and, more importantly, understand the perceived user value behind these features, we spent the first 2 weeks conducting remote stakeholder interviews. Specifically, we spoke with members of the Vermeer commercialization team who had frequent first-hand experience with customers and an understanding of the software.</p>
    <p>Through these conversations we were able to prioritize the features with our client product owner in order to form a high-level backlog for our development team. We also received a demo of the existing software to understand what would be essential to maintain market parity. This kicked off our crash course in directional drilling.</p>

<section>
    <h2 class="subheader">Ideation</h2>
    <p>While familiarizing ourselves with the industry and the needs of a drilling crew out in the field, I started sketching out ideas for the new interface. Without much knoweldge to that point of how a bore plan is created and executed, I began by brainstorming how we could let a drill operator know something significant happened and how they might be able to act on that information.</p>
    <p>The existing software allows drill operators to see their plan on a screen mounted on the rig, and a third-party tool helps drillers see where the drill head is at in real time. This got us thinking of how we might merge this information to create an experience similar to turn-by-turn directions in something like Google Maps or Waze.</p>

    <h2 id="user-research" class="subheader">User Research</h2>
    <p>To enhance our knowledge and better understand who would be using this software, my research colleague and I attended a day-long HDD training seminar at a local community college. An extremely eye opening opportunity, we talked to a variety of vendors and introduced ourselves to a couple drill crews who let us ask them questions and get feedback on our early ideas for the auto-correct feature.</p>

</figure>
<section>
    <p>We learned in these conversations how drillers currently solve the problem of going off plan – sometimes intentionally – and also that large and small crews seemed to operate in significantly different ways when problems arise. Invigorated by these insights, we sought to talk to more crews of varying sizes and work in different soil types.</p>
    <p>Vermeer connected us with a handful of drillers and foremen from across the country. To keep track of their stories, we created a journey map, similar to a game board, for plotting important information that came up during our conversations. We printed icons on different colored stickets to represent key moments and then wrote in the details from beginning to end. This kept the conversation fluid and showed us where we may need to probe further in real time.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Process</span>
    <h2 id="wireframing" class="subheader">Wireframing the Interface</h2>
    <p>Armed with the context of how drill crews perform their jobs and analyze problems, I began blocking out various screens in Adobe XD. Vermeer had adopted Google’s Material Design language for many of it’s newer apps and websites, so I used its guidelines and patterns for a first pass through the key features we were working on.</p>
    <p>Our team had access to a rugged PC setup identical to what is mounted on a rig, and I was able to use the touch screen as a second monitor to display the wireframes and grayscale screens so that we could test font size, contrast, target area, and overall layout.</p>
    <p>This became a valuable focal point within our team space for facilitating conversations with developers and our stakeholders during sprint demos around expected behavior.</p>

<section>
    <h2 id="interaction-design" class="subheader">The FAB Wheel</h2>
    <p>As the interface design matured, my research colleague and I thought about how we could make the main view of the plan cross section more actionable. Using what we learned, we talked through the actions a user may want to take when looking at the plan. We further explored how the touch screen could operate as a means of progressive disclosure, and that led us to the FAB (floating action button) wheel.</p>
    <p>Depending on the screen or object selected, different actions would be shown to the user. During my time on the project there was only a need for a 2-button and 4-button option. However, l also modeled out how other wheels would look to help my team and other designers who come on to support the project later.</p>
    <p>The ticky part came in selecting proper icons so that users were provided the correct affordance for each button. In the beginning, we were nearly spot on, but I made a few iterations over the course of several user testing sessions to make sure each icons was very clear.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Testing Outdoors</h2>
    <p>Once I got the look and feel to a branded state, I brought the rugged PC home to examine the contrast and readability of the interface on a bright, sunny day. I managed to test the display using it’s default factory settings, as well as at 100-percent brightness. These tests led me to increasing in the minimum font size and darkening of some colors that had already met WCAG standards but were still diffult to see in full sunlight. </p>

    <h2 id="user-testing" class="subheader">Iterative Testing with Users</h2>
    <p>We were able to do in-person tests with a couple local drilling companies, as well as a handful of Vermeer employees who work on the manfucaturing and testing of drilling equipment. However, we also did remote user testing using an Adobe XD prototype over Zoom with 8 participants in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
    <p>Leading up to these remote sessions, I became the lone UX representative on the team and assumed the responsibilities of recruiting users and coordinating calendars in addition to the testing itself. I tested with each remote user at least twice – a couple 3 times – though they saw different features each time.</p>
    <p>Each feature I designed for testing was closely associated with a specific scenario, and I would provide participants with reference materials for context, such as a fake visual of an obstacle or mock up plans to edit. Sometimes a feature would still be an early idea, but I would test general usability and also ask for contextual feedback.</p>
    <p>The learnings from this were incredibly valuable, and I was able to make iterative changes on a weekly basis. This helped me understand at granular level how a drill operator or crew supervisor thinks and allowed me to closely map the interface to their mental model.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Additional Design Efforts</h2>
    <p>While revamping the embedded app started as the primary objective, our team was also tasked with leveraging the Windows ecosystem to create a branded, pseduo operating system so only the installed apps could be accessed from the machine.</p>
    <p>A persistent launch bar, fixed to the bottom of the screen, was created to provide quick access to all the apps installed on the device and offer a means to toggle between them while out in the field. This was the first deliverable our team completed so that other developers at Vermeer could immediately adopt it and build companion apps.</p>
    <p>Our team also simultaneously worked on a native mobile app that had many of the same basic features as the embedded solution. A lot of the user feedback gathered helped influence what features would be essential for a MVP and what could be possibly offered behind a paywall. This app went live in the summer of 2019 and is called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boreplan/id1467957378" target="_blank" title="Vermeer BorePlan on the App Store">Vermeer BorePlan, available in the Apple and Android app stores today</a>.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Outcome</span>
    <h2 id="ui-design" class="subheader">Going Full Bore</h2>
    <p>Not only is the new embedded app branded and better organized visually, it also gives users the freedom to create a bore plan directly on the drill. User can edit imported or locally-created plans if they happen to run into issues during execution, then they can be exported onto a portable USB drive and added to printed project reports or other deliverables once the work is complete.</p>
    <p>We also leverage a lot of the same information Vermeer requests from users in the Projects web app around materials and hardware, which allows the system to make quick calculations, which were previously done manually by the driller or another crew member. Overall, the goal was to lower the barrier to entry for smaller crews who may not have access to the same resources available to larger companies.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Reflections &amp; Learnings</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">Liked</h2>
    <p>Emebedded apps were a new frontier for me. I’d mostly designed several web systems leading up to this project, so I enjoyed exploring a different platform and understanding what the possibilities and constraints were when crafting a new UI. Having collaborative teammates also help – especially when they ran into issues and we were able to research and talk through what would be possible to achieve the most desirable experience.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Learned</h2>
    <p>I learned a lot about directional drilling – more than I ever thought I would or could. I think this is where my experience as a journalist benefits me as a UX designer. At the beginning it seemed like there was so much to learn in order to deliver a great product, but persistence and having a client team and users out in the field who were happy to educate me took me a long way. I will always remember what the colored utility flags mean when I see them on the side of the road.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Lacked</h2>
    <p>For a while, our team lacked velocity from a delivery standpoint. While I was able to execute from a design perspective, it took several sprints for the development to catch up. By the end of my time with the team, I was already exploring feature ideas with users that wouldn’t be groomed and put in the backlog for many months. This made it challenging to maintain the same level of collaboration towards the end.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Longed For</h2>
    <p>As I started to roll off the project, the team was in the home stretch of delivering the mobile app. I wished I could have stayed on a bit longer to provide QA or conduct user testing prior to the app going live in the app stores because there are some subtle UI differences I would have advocated against to maintain consistency with what was coming in the embedded app. All of my user testing was with a design prototype too, so it would have been great to test the real product with those same users.</p>
