    <h1>About Ryan</h1>
    <p>I'm Ryan, a designer from Des Moines, Iowa. I like to nerd out about many UX-related topics, such as behavioral psychology, color constancy, human-computer interaction, and typography.</p>
	<p>I am an advocate for accessibility, driven by the empathy required for user-centered design. I don't shy away from user feedback and prefer to be an active participant is usability and user testing sessions.</p>
    <p>I have extensive working experience with HTML and CSS, in addition to CSS pre-processors like Sass. I also know enough JavaScript to be (harmlessly) dangerous. Though these front-end skills serve me well in striking a balance between feasible and innovative experiences, design is first and foremost my one true love.</p>
    <p>I also am very interested in design coaching and mentorship. During my career, I have headed committees, spoken at events, co-organized meetups, and been responsible for reviewing applicant portfolios. One of my proudest career accomplishments has been helping a past employer institute a new hybrid design and front-end role.</p>
    <p>When I am not working, you can usually find me working on my fitness, drawing, or drinking craft brews with my family.</p>
