    <h1>We Design to Communicate</h1>
    <p>This week was <a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-citing-economic-retail-industry-challenges-hy-vee-asks-500-corporate-employees-switch-to-retail/39839406" target="_blank">pretty abysmal at work</a>, and I feel like I've talk to enough people about it already that it's not worth documenting my feelings here. A couple of interesting side conversations spurred deeper thoughts from this situation, though.</p>
    <p>First, this week I got a lot of messages from recruiters on LinkedIn who shared job postings where experience with <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> was essential to the position. Now, while I have been loving Figma and all the things it made easier during the build up of the design system, <b>it is just a tool</b>. Only a few years ago, Sketch and InVision were the best thing ever.</p>
    <p>The major thing Figma has going for it (as of this writing) is the component library. But if a company doesn't need to create and maintain these libraries, Figma is just as good as any other digital design tool out there. The tool is a medium for capturing thought and communicating. Skill with a tool does not a designer make.</p>
    <p>I've been asked this before, but somebody ask me again whether I prefer Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch. My answer? What is the goal; what am I expected to make and why am I making it? If I need to make a flashy prototype to sell or communicate an idea, I may use one program. If I need to build something long-lasting or regularly collaborate with dev teams, I'll probably use something different.</p>
    <p>Second, I think the benefits of Figma's component library feature is why I've seen so many Design System Lead positions popping up recently.</p>
    <p>Creating and maintaining a collection of all the bits and bobs in a company's UI is a foundational part of systems thinking. But a visual "design system" is worthless if other people, who are not designers, don't have access to this library. If there is no code, it is just a bunch of rules and guidelines â€“ communication.</p>
