    <span class="eyebrow">Problem</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">How might we make use of existing navigation patterns to better match shopper mental models and browsing behaviors?</h2>
    <p>Many customer-facing Hy-Vee areas have their own navigation header, creating "seems" in the experience as customers browse different areas of the site. This makes it challenging for people to understand where they are in the digital scope of Hy-Vee. It also makes it difficult to traverse from one area to another, such as going from account info, to recipes, to pharmacy, or even the cart.</p>
    <p>Prior to joining Hy-Vee, the UX group had conducted customer research, including a series of information architecture activities, to evaluate the current navigation structure and identify unmet customer needs. Without a singular team able to assume responsibility for the effort, progress had stalled. In order to breath life back into the project, Hy-Vee needed a group to define a "North Star" vision, as well as look inward to understand other product team needs and technical constraints.</p>
    <p>Since my product team was also taking on the new company design system, I was designated as the new design lead responsible for delivering the global header project across the finish line.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Outcome</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">A Global Affair</h2>
    <p>Designing the navigation proved to be a small part of the overall project. Though the visual design is nondescript, the end result addresses customer needs by confronting development and data gaps that once led to disparate experiences. As we shared the concept with other teams and uncovered technical challenges, collaborating and over-communicating with multiple product teams became essential.</p>
    <p>We quickly understood 3 features would be essential to limiting scope, determining success, and maintaining our sanity: search, store selection, and cart. Opportunities for additional customer research also materialized throughout the process, strengthening the long-term vision and defining our roadmap.</p>
    <p>While on the surafce this appeared to be an opportunity to make flashy, visual enhancements, heuristics tell us that keeping things familiar increases confidence and learnability.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Process</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">Keeping focus on navigation</h2>
    <p>Instead of trying to explore designs for desktop headers, I started with mobile first. Mobile web usage accounted for 55% of online traffic between February & March in 2021 – up 114% from the same time period in 2020 and up more than 350% from 2019, likely due to the pandemic. Hy-Vee had also recently completed improvements to its mobile app, so company executives were ready to align the new web navigation with insights gleaned from the app project.</p>
    <p>Designing mobile first ensures that most important actions are clear and visible. Limited space means targeted conversations with stakeholders, emphasizing necessary actions that are directly tied to desired outcomes.</p>
    <p>Before designing anything, though, I evaluated our existing mobile menus and compared the experience with those from top national competitors. To uncover more helpful navigation patterns, I turned to companies with websites that similar, multi-layered information architecture needs, such as Home Depot and Advanced Auto Parts.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Who Are We Designing For?</h2>
    <p>In spite of the limited data, I elected to sketch out the type of user who would benefit most from a solution to this problem. Not only did this allow me to imagine the experience from another vantage point, but this persona also helped me reframe my ideas and decisions as I got deeper into my process.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Sketching the interface</h2>
    <p>With a concept in mind, I drew out some ideas for a simple app. Because this is meant to help Lilah remember which artists she likes, listing them out front and center seemed the most appropriate for the main screen.</p>
    <p>Since Lilah also enjoys going to the concerts during the festival, it made sense to include a master schedule of all the events, so she and her friends can keep track of what’s happening in real time and set up alerts for anything she wants to see.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">Designing the App Experience</h2>
    <p>One challenege with the Des Moines Arts Festival is that organizers put together a new brand campaign each year for the festival. However, I started with the look and feel from a past year that aligned with the bold, energetic vibe I associate with the event.</p>

    <span class="eyebrow">Reflections &amp; Learnings</span>
    <h2 class="subheader">Liked</h2>
    <p>Not only is the Des Moines Arts Festival one of my favorite local events, arts and culture in general lends itself well to bold and playful themes. I really enjoyed mixing and matching colors and riffing on imagery when working on building a cohesive look and feel to the app. Prototyping and putting together all the screens into a realistic experience is also one of my favorite parts of a project.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Learned</h2>
    <p>Although this project focuses on the design, I learned a lot about Bluetooth technology and Near Field Communications. I had to in order to feel confident in proposing the solution I ultimately came up with. While I abid by a ‘no constraints’ mindset, I am a big believer in designers understanding the capabilities of technology in order to more creatively connect the dots between desireability and feasability.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Lacked</h2>
    <p>I hoped my user questionnaire would have garnered more engagement. While 13 responses is a good number for this small, concepting project, more data needs to be collected from diverse audiences to have a holistic view of user need and desirability. Considerations also need to be made around the business as far as cost in addition to beacon reusability and weatherproofing.</p>
    <h2 class="subheader">Longed For</h2>
    <p>It would have been fantastic to have a development partner building a proof of concept with me during this process. Despite my research to understand what’s possible, it always helps to get something working – even something as simple as an app that triggers a message or logs the data transmitted when a user is in the proximity of a beacon. Since artist tents are pretty close to each other, I am curious to know how these signals could be parsed when multiple beacons are neaby.</p>
